# Beginner Tutorial

## Preparation

1. Install dependencies and initial the package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

2. Run the demo script to see whether everything has been prepared

```bash
cd scripts/beginner
python beginner.py
```

If you see `*** Spark ***` in the terminal, then everything goes well.
